# DUMB OCR

Trying to make OCR because I'm too lazy to type up ~50 different opcodes for my emulation project

## TODO:

[] Implement multi monitor usage, currently only works on main monitor
[] Allow for more complex ocr, only really tested this on typed content so far
[] Remove the overlaid white canvas on the selected area before generating the screen grab
[] Do something with the extracted text that is more than printing to console, copying to clipboard could be a good start
